Hi there! I'm rimoJO. I make programs. Some of them may be interesting.
Most of my projects include:

     - Games

Those take a while to make, so this will pretty much be other, smaller applications

I'll put game source code when I can, though.

I know a few languages, which include:

     - C++
     - QBasic
     - Visual Basic 6 (Or any non-.NET version)
     - C#/Mono (I use Unity)
     - HTML to some extent
     - English

There isn't much to say aside from that, though
Thanks for visiting! :D
